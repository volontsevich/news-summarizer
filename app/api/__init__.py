# NOTE FOR COPILOT:
# - Do not hard-code secrets. Read from app.core.config.Settings.
# - Use type hints, docstrings, structured logging, and retries where appropriate.
# - Keep functions small/testable. No global state.
# - Regex with re.IGNORECASE and safe timeouts.
# - Enforce LLM token limits/chunking; never send secrets.
# - Use DB sessions from app.db.session; commit safely.
# - Respect cron settings from env for schedules.
